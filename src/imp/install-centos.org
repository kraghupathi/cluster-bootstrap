* Partitions
  Three partitions - =/boot=, =swap= and =/= are made.
  Refer to an [[https://superuser.com/a/522998][explanation]] why these partitions are
  necessary.  
  - The size of boot is set to 1 GB.  Though CentOS
    [[https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.2/Installation_Guide/s2-diskpartrecommend-s390.html][recommends]] 100MB, the boot partition is bumped to 1 GB.
  - The size of swap is set to 16 + 2 = 18 GB. [[https://itsfoss.com/swap-size/][Reference]]
  - Another partition =/boot/efi= is necessary for centos to
    [[https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4444][support]](regamboa) [[https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Unified-Extensible-Firmware-Interface-UEFI][UEFI]].  This requires GPT(GUID
    partition tables) to be present.  If MBR is required,
    format the hard disk and re-partition as GPT.

* Installation of Other packages
  1. Ansible. (V2.4.2)
